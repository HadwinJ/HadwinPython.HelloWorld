Structure and Behavior
* Classes define the structure and behavior of objects
* An object's class controls its initialization

Classes are a Tool
* Classes make complex problems tractable
* Classes can make simple solutions overly complex

Initialization
* __init__() is an initializer, not a constrctor
* self is similar to this in C++ or Java
